### Overview

A remake of Sulake.com circa 2004 using more modern techniques and technologies, an MMOCC (massivley multiplayer online chat community developer) and early online game developer. [You can see an example of this hosted at http://portfolio.howe.pm/2004/](http://portfolio.howe.pm/2004/).



I used SASS for the CSS.



A screenshot is available, although I think visiting the live site may be a little better.
